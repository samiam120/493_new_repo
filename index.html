        <p>The way in which we interact with the world is constantly changing, yet there still seems to be a barrier that remains for people with motor impairments: to be able to navigate and fill out web forms easily. <em>Form-igate</em> emerges as a solution to this problem. Offering voice-activated controls over google form interaction. This chrome extension not only empowers users to input data using voice commands but also saves information for auto fill later, making recurrent tasks more manageable. Solving this problem is important, as it promotes independence and inclusivity, to ensure that the online-landscape is accessible to everyone regardless of physical ability.

        <p>
          There have been many efforts in the realm of assistive technologies that paved the way for innovations like <em>Form-igate</em>.  Speech Recognition softwares for instance have been instrumental for users with motor disabilities. These allow for voice typing and the ability to navigate. However, the integration with web forms have fallen short in terms of intuitive form filling and retaining data. Form-igate stands on these giants, learning from their limitations and enhancing the user expierence by streamlining the form interaction process specifically.

      <section aria-labelledby="methodology">
        <h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
        <p>The methodology underpinning Form-igate's creation was rooted in the principles of agile development. The project began with a analysis of the user experience of the web for individuals with motor disabilities. Focusing on these challenges they faced, a set of functionalities were derived. This included voice-activated navigation, command interprtation, and data storage to help make an autofill.</p>
        <p>Prototyping played a crucial role in Form-igate's development. What originally started as a web form website that took voice commands, through refinement, not only was this able to become an extension, but more sophisticated features were integrated. Each iteration were subject to many tests that involved trial and error. </p>

      <section aria-labelledby="disability-justice">
        <h2 id="disability-justice">Disability Justice Perspective</h2>
        <p>A disability justice perspective was important to Form-igate's development. it recognized the intersectional nature of potential users, by acknowledging that users with motor disabilities have varying backgrounds. This perspective helps ensure that Form-igate is not just a tool for accessibility but a step towards user empowerment. By providing a free adaptable tool that goes beyond basic requirement.</p>
